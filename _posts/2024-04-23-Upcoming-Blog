# Upcoming Linux writeup

While I don't have time for a massive blog post today, tommorow, I will be posting a writeup on why I personally use Linux over Windows, and briefly touch on MacOSX.

Might also do a writeup later on for a beginners guide to all things Linux if I feel like it. Might be fun.
