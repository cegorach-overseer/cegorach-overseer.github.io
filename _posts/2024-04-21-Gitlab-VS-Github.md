#Why I chose Github

Initially, I wanted to create and post my Jekyll blog utilizing Gitlab Pages but decided against it.

While I'm always for supporting OSS, I am also a dumbass in using Git. Creating this blog has actually been my first experience utilizing any sort of Git technology in a project. For now I've decided to use Github purely for the reason that the theme I wanted to use was already configured with a Github Action to deploy it with commits.

All in all, I just wanted something simple for now. Hell, I had to spend half an hour trying to rollback one of my commits due to a mess up. In the future, I do plan to move my website and any future projects from Github over to Gitlab. Anyways, that's for now. More posts to come in the future.
