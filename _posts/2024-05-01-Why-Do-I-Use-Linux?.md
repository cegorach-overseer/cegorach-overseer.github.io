# Why did I decide to swap to Linux?

I used to hold myself to using Windows simply because it was what I always knew, the same goes for many.
In a sense, Windows is the 'PC' for a grand majority of people. The same way Apple is the 'Phone' for the grand majority.
Now, if I was using something that worked, what ultimately prompted me to switch? or even consider it in the first place?
For me, it was namely how obtrusive Windows as a whole felt:

- The constant nagging for a Microsoft account alongside pushes to Onedrive.
- The spyware levels of data collection.
- Forced updates that break any custom modifications you've made to your system.
- The drip feeding of features that already existed but were removed.
- The continually increasing levels of hardware obsoletion that will eventually near Apple standards.
- Lack of access to the system itself.
- Limted ability to fine tune the system to how you want it to be.

Windows by design is meant to be a 'One size fits all' operating system. It was meant to be rather simple and intuitive to pick up and learn. But by design, that also limits its functionality.
Increasingly, I felt I was fighting the operating system to get it to do what I wished rather than actually using my computer.
And, even though at the end of the day when you're using your system, most of your customization choices will be covered up by windows anyways, having the option to customize it in the first place is what matters.
After these feelings with Windows, I turned my eyes towards MacOS. But yet again, it's another walled garden. Not to mention the fact you need to spend around $1500 on a device to use it on bare-metal in the first place.

After fully realizing my issues with both operating systems and knoowing what I was looking for in a system, I turned my eyes to Linux (or rather GNU/Linux. Don't smite me).

## Picking a Distribution?

This is a gatekeeper or rather a checkpoint where many people stop at and turn back. Many people are simply paralysed by the 'versions' of Linux that are offered to them. They don't know which is 'right'.
To put it simply for most. The only things that will change between distributions is:

- The package manager(how you will install and manage applications. Or in terms of Linux, packages).
- Your starting applications that will be installed.
- What desktop enviroment/Window Manager  will be installed(Will be shortened to DE'/WM' for the rest of this post).
- The installation process
- Frequency/Style of Updates

Your linux distribution is, in a sense, a coat of paint over your system. 
No matter which distribution you choose, you can get them to mostly function, perform, and look exactly the same.
Don't worry about which distribution is the 'best'. If you're new to linux all together and want something that will get you started quickly with minimal effort, I would say pick Linux Mint. If you want something more in depth and want to dive into the deep end, choose Arch Linux.

## Why did I pick Arch Linux?

I picked Arch Linux purely because it was minimal. I also like the idea of installing each part of my system manually and learning that way.
There is always the Archinstall script that you can use to get yourself up and running in a few minutes but it detracts from what Arch is about in the first place.
By using Archinstall (at least as a beginner) you're robbing yourself of the oppertunity to learn how your system actually functions.
If you ask for help on the Reddit or the Wiki then it will take way longer to resolve your issues if you don't know how your drives are mounted, what your bootloader is, what kernel your using, etc.
If you do start with Arch Linux as a first distribution. I highly reccomend setting aside a few hours to read through the wiki and go through the installation process step by step.
It's both fun and incredibly rewarding to have a feeling of understanding and pride when you move through each step, knowing that you've learned about your system just a tiny bit more.
Another choice you will run into using Arch is having (or not for your crackheads) to pick a DE' or WM', which I will cover in a following post, along with the difference in X11 and Wayland in the modern day.

## Conclusion

Transitioning from Windows to Linux out of my frustrations for the operating system has been both hard but incredibly rewarding.
The numerous options and customizations that Linux offers is incredibly appealing and even if you don't want to wipe your Windows installation and try Linux from there.
Get an old hardrive or even a tiny SSD for cheap and run it from there. I still have a Windows boot I use for games like Rainbow Six Siege and League of Legends among other things.
While Linux might not be for everyone, I do highly reccomend that you try it at least once.
